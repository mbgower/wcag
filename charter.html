				<h2>Background</h2>
				<section id="background-ag">
					<h3>Motivation for Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)</h3>
					<p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, and also benefits older users and people without disabilities. Accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, and across different devices. It is essential that several different components of web development and interaction work together in order for the web to be accessible to people with disabilities. These components include content technologies, web content, web browsers and media players, assistive technology, users, developers, authoring tools, and evaluation tools. Groups in the Web Accessibility Initiative work together to address accessibility for all the components.</p>
					<p>The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group describes the characteristics of accessible web content, in the form of guidance to content developers. It also describes support from other components needed for its advice to work, such as technologies, user agents, and authoring tools. Guidelines from this Working Group are widely used by developers and implementers, referenced in industry policy, and benefit all web users.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="background-focus">
					<h3>Focus for the 2022 - 2024 Charter</h3>
					<p>The goal of this 2022 - 2024 AG WG charter will be to put into wide (public) review one or more draft documents that demonstrate all major components of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3</a> and how they fit together. During this charter period, the WG will propose an approach for public review that addresses each of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/#requirements">WCAG 3 requirements</a> and known challenges. Examples of known challenges include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rewriting existing guidelines,</li>
						<li>Adding guidance to address known gaps in WCAG 2,</li>
						<li>Creating new guidelines for emerging technologies, and</li>
						<li>Complex conformance questions, such as third-party content, scoring, accessibility statements, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Requirements or challenges will need a demonstrated solution that has AG WG consensus by the end of this charter or will be excluded from WCAG 3. Solutions will not all be complete at the end of this charter period, but they will be sufficiently mature so that reviewers can understand the intended scope of WCAG 3 as a whole, and will have enough depth to understand how conformance evaluations for WCAG 3 will work.</p>
					<p>By the end of the 2022 - 2024 charter AG WG will: </p><ul>
						<li>Know what will and will not be part of WCAG 3,</li>
						<li>have a timeline for delivering WCAG 3, and </li>
						<li>have decided how WCAG 3 will be delivered (all at once, in phases, or as modules.) </li>
					</ul> In the case of phases or modules, AG WG will have the scope and requirements of those phases or modules defined for the next charter period. </section>
			</section>
			<section id="scope" class="scope">
				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<section id="scope-wcag3">
					<h3>WCAG 3 </h3>
					<p>The primary objective of the AG WG during this charter period is to publish one or more <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#wide-review">wide review draft(s)</a> of WCAG 3. The goal is to get broad support for the scope and direction of WCAG 3 and work out how the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">requirements for WCAG 3</a> can be met, including better coverage across disabilities, and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable as technologies evolve. These wide review(s) of WCAG 3 will include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A preliminary set of guidelines (not including outcomes or methods),</li>
						<li>A representative set of outcomes worked out in detail, along with all methods and documentation necessary to understand and test those outcomes,</li>
						<li>At least one example of each type/category of testing or evaluation approach, </li>
						<li>A candidate conformance model, and</li>
						<li>An approach on testing emerging technologies (if included).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>WCAG 3 will not be brought to Recommendation during this charter period. Results of the wide review(s) will determine scope and timeline for further work in the following charter period. Deliverables and timelines for WCAG 3 are further precised in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag3/wiki#WCAG3_Project_Plan">WCAG 3 project plan</a>.</p>
					<section id="scope-wcag3-additional">
						<h4>Additional WCAG 3 Publications</h4>
						<p>AG WG will explore options for publishing WCAG 3 in stages or as modules. If any part of the initial WCAG 3 will be published as a stand-alone resource, a draft will be made available within this charter period. If a transitional document between WCAG 2.2 and WCAG 3 is to be created (such as a WCAG 2.3 or WCAG 2.9), a first draft of it will be published by the end of the charter.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section id="scope-wcag3-conformance">
					<h4>WCAG 3 Conformance Model</h4>
					<p>In this charter period, AG WG will define a working conformance model for WCAG 3. If any part of the initial WCAG 3 recommendation will be published as a stand-alone resource, a draft will be made available within this charter period.</p>
					<p>WCAG 3 will not include normative guidance for stand-alone user agents or authoring tools, however, it may include guidelines for embedded user agents such as an online video player built with JavaScript and HTML, and authoring tools such as an online blogging service.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="scope-other">
					<h3>Non WCAG 3 Scope</h3>
					<p>In addition to WCAG 3, the group continues existing work and materials support commitments:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>updates <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/"><u>WCAG2ICT</u></a> with non-normative guidance on applying WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 to non-web technology,</li>
						<li>continues addressing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues"><u>open WCAG 2 issues</u></a> and public feedback and maintains interpretive support materials for its normative guidance (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/"><u>Understanding WCAG 2</u></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/"><u>WCAG 2 Techniques</u></a>),</li>
						<li>performs secondary research, and engages with primary researchers, to understand better the needs of specific user groups (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/low-vision-needs/">Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-user-research/">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a>),</li>
						<li>conducts gap analyses against deployed features to identify accessibility guidance needs (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-gap-analysis/">Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/">Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile</a>),</li>
						<li>develops Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.1, to keep ACT rules compatible with WCAG 3, and enable writing rules that have proven difficult to write under version 1.0,</li>
						<li>provides evaluation guidance and test materials to support verification of conformance to normative guidance (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.0/">Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0</a>),</li>
						<li>develops supplemental guidance, beyond that in the normative guidance, that describes enhanced accessibility for certain scenarios (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a>), and</li>
						<li>maintains errata for content developed by predecessor groups (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="section-out-of-scope">
					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>
					<ul class="out-of-scope">
						<li>The AG WG is not, and does not aspire to be, the central repository for accessibility support data.</li>
						<li>The AG WG does not perform conformance evaluations and reviews.</li>
						<li>The AG WG does not provide normative guidance on non-web technologies; however, informational guidance may include examples outside the scope of the web.</li>
						<li>The AG WG is not currently working on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines</a> or the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines</a> specifications, except to maintain errata, though some content may be relevant to and included in WCAG 3.</li>

			<section id="success-criteria">
				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
				<p> In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
				<p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
				<p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
				<p>There should be sufficient techniques and tests for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="coordination">
				<h2>Coordination</h2>
				<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation"
					>CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
					occur in a specification following a review.</p>

The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
				<p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group home page</a>. </p>
				<p>This group conducts email discussion on the public mailing list <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org" id="public-name">w3c-wai-gl@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/">archive</a>). <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/">Task forces</a> and sub-groups may use additional lists or other communication mechanisms documented on their home pages. Discussion of issues for specific deliverables generally takes place in the GitHub repository identified for the deliverable. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. </p>
				<p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>

				<h2> Decision Policy </h2>
				<p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.1, Consensus</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
				<p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections. </p>
				<p>The Working Group maintains specific procedures to establish and measure consensus and address objections in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/decision-policy">AG Working Group Decision Policy</a>.</p>
				<p class="todo">Note: The AG WG has maintained a supplemental decision policy to support the review needed for decisions that can impact regulatory content. A recent update preserves this for stable content while reducing procedural requirements for content that is still under development. The scope of this charter combines <em>maintenance of the mature WCAG 2.x</em> with <em>innovation of WCAG 3</em>. Because of this complex scope, the WG chairs view the decision policy changes as essential to WG success. The updated decision policy should be reviewed together with this draft charter.</p>
				<p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
